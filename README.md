# My Portfolio Website

This website is a template graciously provided my Microsoft on GitHub. The focus was to show off Github Codespaces and how powerful it could be. The site itself is a [.NET personal portfolio](https://github.com/github-education-resources/codespaces-project-template-dotnet) frontend web application using the [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82024-juyoo) WebAssembly framework and is fully populated with sample data that can be changed to what ever you need it to be to match you.

I first found this template from a [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv400yTmRGA) from the [dotnet channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dotnet). The beautiful thing about it is that its fully configured and built for you to just start ising it. You can of course customize it your liking but out of the box it is really nice looking and functional. I decided to use this template as I'm also on my journey to learing more on the .NET ecosystem, specifically C#/Blazor. I'm also woking on earning a [Free C# Certification from Microsoft and freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-microsoft-c-sharp-certification/). This is a fantastic opertunite provided by Microsoft and freeCodeCamp and is a prefect entry point into programming for ANYONE to take advantage. My goals for this course is how I can incorperate programming into my daily life to help sove problems or just make mine or someone else's life easier.
